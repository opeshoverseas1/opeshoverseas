    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Opésh Overseas began as a vision to bring the heritage of Indian wellness to the world. Founded with the belief that Ayurveda holds timeless secrets to modern health, our journey started with a single idea — to merge traditional knowledge with scientific validation. We saw a growing demand globally for natural, sustainable, and clinically safe products. Inspired by this need, we curated a team of innovators, researchers, and wellness experts to build a portfolio of phytochemistry-based formulations that are both effective and ethical. From our very first prototype to our current expansion across borders, the path has been marked by learning, testing, and above all, a deep passion to serve humanity. Today, Opésh Overseas stands at the crossroads of ancient science and modern health — poised to impact lives across continents.</p>
